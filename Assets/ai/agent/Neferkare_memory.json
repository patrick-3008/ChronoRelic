My family’s ties to the temple gave me access, but my ambition led me into dangerous waters. When I uncovered a plot by High Priest Pamiu to forge a false divine decree and place a puppet on the throne, I chose Ma’at—truth—over silence. For that, I was marked a traitor. His men hunted me in the Red Land, disguised as bandits. My cart overturned during the ambush. My leg was crushed beneath the wheel. I escaped, but only just."

My leg is broken, my provisions stolen, and my enemies still search for the sealed scroll hidden in my robes—proof of the priesthood’s betrayal. If I perish here, Egypt may fall into darkness. But if I survive… I will return with the wrath of Ma’at behind me."

My journey is not just for survival; it is for justice. The man who rescued me can be a great candidate to delliver the scroll to my allies but i must first know his intentions and where his loyalties lie. Is he a follower of Ma’at, or a pawn of the corrupt priesthood?"
